Simple posting application that utilises a RESTful API in order to send posts from a database on the server to be rendered on the client using a front-end framework.

For this task I have chosen to use a combination of light-weight technologies that put an emphasis on rapid deployment. 
The Python web-framework, Flask, was used in conjuction with SQLite to deploy the user posts to the client in the JSON file format. 
Backbone.js was chosen as a front end framework to deal with the templating (underscore) and rendering of the post data on the client side. 
Backbone embodies a no-batteries included approach and it's Model/View architecture helps to keep the script clean and readable. 
Bootstrap was chosen as a html framework for its mobile-first capabilities and the responsive grid system.
